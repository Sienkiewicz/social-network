## Description

It's a platform for practice, not for build new brand facebbok. <br>

I used simple free API with users, where I can: 
- build my profile
- follow/unfollow users
- change status
- change links for social networks
- add avatar
- load users
- login/logout
- use simple captcha, when I write wrong email or pass repeatedly

## About the project

It's not my project. This API is creates a tough guy from Belarus. [deep and cool tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8) I learned from his tutorials, but a lot of his code is outdated, and I rewrite  a lot of things to new code using new tools, such as hooks or formic instead redux-form (it's easier).
It's a long project for my practice. If you notice, some page is not ready.

## Future scope
- add **news**, **settings**, posibly music.
- add a simple search for users.
- rewrite this code on **typescript**.
